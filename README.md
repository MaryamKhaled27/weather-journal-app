## Project Requirements
This project requires to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

### Project Instructions

1 setting up project environment by install node.js & Installing the packages Express, Body-Parser, and Cors from the terminal.

2 Create API credentials on OpenWeatherMap.com &  JavaScript Object named projectData initiated in the file server.js to act as the app API endpoint.<br> saving APIKey in a const variable & passed as a parameter to fetch() .

3 GET route setup on the server side with the first argument as a string naming the route, and the second argument a callback function to return the JS object created at the top of server code.

4 add a POST route that adds incoming data to projectData. After successfulling retrieval of the weather data, we chain another Promise that makes a POST request to add the API data, as well as data entered by the user, to app.

5 Finally, chain another Promise that updates the UI dynamically Write another async function to retrieve that appâ€™s data on the client side, existing DOM elements should have their innerHTML properties dynamically set according to data returned by the app route.

#### Developing Tool
